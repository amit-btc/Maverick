Aliasing `superagent` as `request` is nice:\n\t *\n\t *      request = superagent;\n\t *\n\t *  We can use the promise-like API, or pass callbacks:\n\t *\n\t *      request.get('/').end(function(res){});\n\t *      request.get('/', function(res){});\n\t *\n\t *  Sending data can be chained:\n\t *\n\t *      request\n\t *        .post('/user')\n\t *        .send({ name: 'tj' })\n\t *        .end(function(res){});\n\t *\n\t *  Or passed to `.send()`:\n\t *\n\t *      request\n\t *        .post('/user')\n\t *        .send({ name: 'tj' }, function(res){});\n\t *\n\t *  Or passed to `.post()`:\n\t *\n\t *      request\n\t *        .post('/user', { name: 'tj' })\n\t *        .end(function(res){});\n\t *\n\t * Or further reduced to a single call for simple cases:\n\t *\n\t *      request\n\t *        .post('/user', { name: 'tj' }, function(res){});\n\t *\n\t * @param {XMLHTTPRequest} xhr\n\t * @param {Object} options\n\t * @api private\n\t
